This is the third project of the Web Development program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief provided via Figma. It includes a full functioning interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make minor adjustments to their own profile. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
